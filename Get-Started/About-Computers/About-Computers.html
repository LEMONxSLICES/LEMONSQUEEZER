        <h2>So We communicate with a computer using coding but computers don't understand it directly . Computers <span style="color:red">ONLY</span> speaks 0's and 1's . 0's and 1's ? They are called <sapn style="color:blueviolet">Binary</sapn> . OK ... A Quick Lesson about Computer Hardware . </h2>

        <h1 style="margin-left : 450px ;">TRANSISTOR</h1>
        <h2>This piece my friend exist inside every computer . So what do we mean by 0 and 1 [ Binary ] , They are just a meaningful term to identify if the electricity flow through the transistor , if it is then the computer sends 0 , if it is not , it sends 1 . So what is the factor that change transistor phase from 0 to 1 [ <span style="color:red">OFF</span> / <span style="color:green">ON</span> ] . Us , we tell the computer what to to do so we command it whether it turn the transistor on / off [ 1 / 0 ] . Are they required for this lesson ? perhaps they are essential to understand how computers works exactly , computers are not magical machines they are just complex . </h2>

        <h1 style="margin-left : 400px ;">TRANSISTOR-WORK</h1>
        <h2>So lets make a sumup . Transistor controll the flow of electricity , and if transisitor is ON [ electrcity flow ] it sends 1 , if transistor is OFF [ no electricity flow ] it sends 0 , how it change ? According to our commands . But HOW ? i mean computers understand more than that , it can make calulations and display colors . YES , Computers can do that by using a <span style="color:rgb(124, 217, 240)">combination of Transistor</span> . Now a days computers have billions of transistors under the hood , For Example if we have 2 transistors the first is <span style="color:green">ON</span> and second is <span style="color:green">ON</span> it gives the number 3 . In computers when working with binary systems , they call the transistors a <span style="color:red">BIT</span> [ 3 bit = 3 transistors ] , and each transistor can hold a Binary number [ 0 / 1 ] and by the combination we can make all the numbers , characters , words , fonts , symbols ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXxwr66Y79Y">Video</a></h2>

        <h2>The Processor or <span style="color:gold">CPU</span> ( Central Process Unit ) is the man in charge inside the computer body , it take the commands , analyze , scan , calculate , sends and recieve . Inside the processor there is many other pieces that do the work for us [ ALU , Control Unit , Memory Unit ] and of course there is no need to memorize them . OKAY ... But if the process is in the center and don't move , then who control the transmission ? <span style="color:green">Buses</span> they are lines of silicon than transmit the electricity and change transistors phase [ ON / OFF ] and by that processor take the command analyze it then send it to us</h2>
        <h2>And if you were Wondering what is the <span style="color:rgb(58, 58, 255)">" Intel "</span> means [ on the CPU ] , it is the company that manufacture this ships [ CPU ] , and of course there is other companies but this is the most popular one . </h2>
